# jQuery Calculator

## File

* [`jquery-calculator-starter`](Unsolved/jquery-calculator.html)

## Instructions

### Setup together 

#### Only one person per group needs to complete these steps
* Create a repo on Github, make sure to include a README.md and a .gitignore (choose the Node.js option)

* Navigate to Settings -> Manage Access, Use the invite a collaborator button and add your teammates by email or GitHub name

* Clone down the newly created repo

* Add, commit, and push `jquery-calculator.html`, `style.css`, and `logic.js` to your groups repo.

* Slack me a list of your group members and a link to the repo

#### As a group

* Have everyone else clone down the repo.

* Have each person work in their own branch before making any changes by using `git checkout -b your_name_here`;

* Pick one person to be the "pilot" and share their screen. They will be the one entering the code you are working on together.

* Throughout the activity we will have you "switch" pilots by creating Pull Requests and merging your changes into the main branch.

#### Now together

* Create the JavaScript logic inside `logic.js` necessary to add functionality to the jQuery Calculator.

* Your calculator should be able to handle basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

* You should be making use of the existing buttons.

* You should be making use of the existing placeholders for entering content (i.e. "firstNumber", "operator", "secondNumber", "result").

* You should have fun and push yourselves! This is a challenge activityâ€”which means, if you get it done, you are a King of jQuery. If you don't, no sweat. The important thing is that you learned at least a FEW things along the way.
